function res = linesweeter(lines, param)
% LINESWEETER "Sweetens" lines by applying several filters. 
% "Sweeten" in this sense means: Make the line look better.
%
% RES = linesweeter(LINES, PARAM)
% Sweetens lines by applying several filters and enhancers. After each
% step, lines without any entries are removed.
%
% LINES: Matrix with each row defining one line, the number of columns is
%   aequivalent to the number of A-Scans in a B-Scan. The OCTSEG line
%   definition is: A row vector with as much entries as A-Scans in an B-Scan.
%   The entries corresond to positions (z-direction) in an A-Scan. If the
%   entry is 0, no line is present.
% PARAM: A 4x7 matrix defining the parameters for the filters/enhancers. It
%   can be set only partially, the remaining values are set to default. 
%   A value of 0 in the matrix counts as not set. If a filter/enhancer
%   requires less than 3 parameters, the corresponding columns are filled
%   from top.
%   The first line of PARAM defines which filters/enhancers to apply. 
%   The order and function is:
%   1) PreMedian: A simple median filter
%   2) Freedrop: Remove line segments, that have no other line segment to
%      their left or right within a certain range. All lines are looked at
%      for each segment.
%   3) Polyfit: Remove linepoints with the greatest distance to a fitting
%      polynom. Each line is processed separately. A polynom is fitted
%      trough the whole line, then the line is split in aequidistant parts.
%      Only a percentage of the points with the smallest distance to the
%      polynom is kept for each part.
%   4) Shortdrop: Remove short line segments under a certain length.
%   5) Interpolate: Fill gaps in each line by linear interpolation.
%   6) PostMedian: A simple median filter.
%   7) Gauss: Gaussian smoothing.
%   Lines 2-4 of the parameter matrix define the parameters for the
%   enhancers/filters.
%   Parameters are:
%   |width nhsize       keepPercent minlength 0       width var|
%   |0     minNum       polydegree  0         0       0     0  |
%   |0     savelength   parts       0         0       0     0  |
%   width: Width of the 1D median filter
%   nhsize: Neighborhood size around the endpoint of a line, where other
%       points are searched. Square sized, where the length of the square is
%       nhwith*2+1
%   minNum: Minimum number of neighbor points required
%   savelength: Line segments with this lengths are for sure not deleted.
%   keepPercent: This percentage is kept for each part.
%   polydegree: Polynom degree
%   parts: Number of aequidistant parts
%   minlength: Minimum length of the kept line segments
%   width: Width of the 1D median filter
%   var: Variance of the applied 1D gaussian.
% RES: The resulting sweetend lines.
